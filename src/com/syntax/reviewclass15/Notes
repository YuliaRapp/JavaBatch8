Polymorphism:
polymorphism is the ability of the object to take many forms
polymorphism - can be achieved in 2 ways  : overloading(static)/compile time,
dynamic (overriding)/runtime
For overriding to work we must have a relationship of inheritance between two classes.
The things which do not play their part in inheritance can not be overridden
private members, initializer block and constructors
2) if a method is final we can not override it.
3) if a class is final we can not override anything from that class because we can not
inheritance from that class
Must have for overriding
1) method signature must be same i.e name of the method parameter sequence types and number of
parameters
2) Return type should be same
3)we can not narrow the visibility for example if a method has a public access modifier we can make it private
