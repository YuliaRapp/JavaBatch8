Process of hiding implementation details and showing only the important

Real Life Examples
We use different different apps like whatsapp we just write the text and click on share
button we don't care how that text is the converted in the form of signals and sent to
the other party we just select the contact and write text click on send button text is
sent
2) Think of the car we don't care how the engine works we only care how to use steering gas paddle
all of the internal details have been hidden from us.
3) Other examples when we put food into the microwave we don't care how it works we just
set the timer and the temperature.
